      <td>Germany is well known for its massive punk rock scene, but the global focus on hardcore kind of overshadows an incredibly important moment in music history: the German emo revolution of the late 90s. Levin is a shining example of that era, refined English vocals and driving guitars appearing through a fog of beautiful noise. Traditional song structure and some heavy instrumentals coming in early make this track endlessly listenable, but every time you hit repeat, you discover some new intricacy in the guitars or vocals that seemingly wasn’t there before. In this way, Relief occupies a similar space to American compatriots Texas is The Reason and Sunny Day Real Estate, but experienced none of the mainstream success those bands did, which is a massive shame. Sometimes shit just works out like that, but at least the incredible online community that’s formed around music like this has ensured that anyone in the world can appreciate this amazing record.</td>

      <td>As the penultimate song on <i>The Cowboy's Plane Game</i> compilation fades out in a feedbacked wail, you expect the ender to be just as hardcore as the rest of the album. Instead, you’re greeted by the simple, warm chords, and serene vocals of Hello Kitty’s yet-unknown frontwoman. Acoustic guitar and a quiet bassline weave together to create an incredibly tangible sense of melancholy, while simultaneously encouraging peaceful reminiscence. Vocals about obeying your parents and the inclusion of the titular childhood rhyme reinforce the theme of lost youth present in so many emo recordings, but there’s no buildup. There’s no tension behind the scenes, no pipe waiting to burst. Chu-Chu is just a remembrance of simpler times, but not necessarily better ones. I think that makes it all the more impactful.</td>

      <td>This song puts me to sleep, but not in a bad way. As referenced by the fact that it’s Nino’s Dream Remix, this record is a wild, beautiful, and slightly confusing journey straight out of REM sleep. A lot of the breakbeat hardcore genre falls into the all-too-common trap of simple, repetitive, piano melodies, and thudding breakbeats, a formula that creates some excellent club tracks, but doesn’t really translate to the home stereo. Euphoria is elevated from that norm by its use of airy synths, complex webs of vocal samples, and a constant evolution present throughout the entire track. The songwriting really stands out: even with its six and a half minute runtime, it’s over before you even realize it. This can most likely be traced back to Nino’s day job as a producer and writer for tons of dance music’s biggest stars - he even lifted vocal stems from a track he wrote a few years prior for Natasha Mayne. The only real gripe I have with this track is that it may stray a little too far into home-listening territory, with sections where the drums cut out and the key suddenly changes making the track a little less danceable. All in all, Nino’s cut of Euphoria is a prime example of the breakbeat hardcore genre and basically the exact opposite of a nightmare.</td>
