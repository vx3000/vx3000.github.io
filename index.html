        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br>Volume 4 takes an incredibly international approach to the genre, and my favorite band comes from Sweden. I’ve been a fan of the John Doe Band and Supergirl in specific since long before I fully explored the Emo Diaries, and this was one of the songs that inspired me to start this whole series. While it’s always being pushed forward by a driving drum beat, the track still retains some older emo sensibilities with dynamic changes and some strained vocals near the end. Most of the time, though, Supergirl is far into emocore territory with layered vocals and guitar riffs reminiscent of Texas Is The Reason or Sunny Day Real Estate. It isn’t a knock-off though, with some pretty cool and unique touches like the tambourine and the “doo doo doo doo doooooo” section firmly placing it in its own special niche. It’s really a shame that there aren’t many tracks like this on their other releases, but the split they did with legendary Swedish emo band Far Apart is still definitely worth checking out. While it came out in 98’, “At The Kerb” is an excellent, excellent track that follows a more early 90s formula. Please, listen to the John Doe Band.
