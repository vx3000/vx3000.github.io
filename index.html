        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br> I’ve noticed that I’m not actually the biggest fan of straight up old school “real” emo, with my tastes settling somewhere on the boundary that the genre share with punk and hardcore. That’s reflected in my pick off the second volume, Buford’s After Dark. Unlike the rest of the compilation, After Dark keeps a consistent, driving beat, with incredibly fast and repetitive drums reminiscent of melodic punk. The drumming is definitely the defining feature of the track, with constant half-time transitions and some really impressive bass and cymbal work. The actual instrument itself is mixed just right, snappy and high-pitched, making an impact without being too loud or grating. Away from the set, the guitars engage in some really interesting call-and-response layering and the bass lays down the foundation for the whole thing, endlessly fast and consistent to match the drums. The incredibly strained vocals of Sharif Dumani are probably the weakest point in the entire track, but he does a good job conveying emotion and hits some pretty cool notes during the chorus, so I can’t really complain. It’s not really what you listen to emo for, anyway. Technical skill and songwriting that follows the traditional mold of what’s “good” take a backseat to the festering, raw sentiment behind the track, and After Dark has that in droves.
