        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br>Volume 6 is one of the weaker entries in the series, but Kent by Barcode stands out from the rest of the (honestly kind of bad) album. Another left-field European band, Barcode does an excellent job of hiding that they’re so far from the birthplace of emo. The vocals on Kent are reminiscent of Dave Grohl, and the instrumentation brings to mind The Promise Ring or Texas Is The Reason. It isn’t all just shameless repurposing of other bands, though. They secure their own unique niche with a synth coming in later in the song, and some excellent layering of instruments and a background vocalist near the end. One thing this song is really good at is creating that slow buildup, even though the song already starts with loud instrumentals and a driving drum beat. You still feel that catharsis, that emotional release, even though the song never really has a moment where it becomes abundantly clear that this is the section where it gets loud and crashy and complex, it just keeps building. At the end of the song, everything slams to a halt, and the band plays out to a simple melody of a twinkly lead and bassy rhythm guitar. Barcode is really interesting, as the band is essentially a revolving door. They’ve been through a ton of configurations, and most of the time they sound like rage against the machine with an eastern european accent, so this song was a positive surprise.
