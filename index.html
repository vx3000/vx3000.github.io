        <a href= "https://youtu.be/o1X_Eii1eR8" target="_blank">Key Of Soul - Shine
        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">Previously, we covered the very origins of deep house with Can You Feel It. Now, we’re moving into a track that I believe perfected the genre, Shine by Key Of Soul. A side project of underrated electronic pioneer Dan Curtin, Key of Soul eschewed his more experimental side and focused on groove above everything else. The same TR-909 drums and Juno-60 synth pads are there, but instead of being a static track, Shine evolves constantly. While there aren’t any significant key changes or differences in instrumentation, there is an incredibly subtle shifting throughout the entire song. Not one section sounds the same as another, but you could listen to any one and be happy with it repeating throughout the entire song. It’s all tied together by occasional vocals coming in from Japanese R&B singer Itoko, giving the song a little, well, soul. As the track moves on, it starts getting more and more complex, but never suffers for it. Every beat, every hit, every synth stab is put in a place that just sounds right.</p>
