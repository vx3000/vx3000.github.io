        <a href= "https://youtu.be/WdSAHpfMgO8?t=120" target="_blank">Houseboy - Okay
        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">I tend to gravitate towards the emo side of 90s rock, but Okay (and this entire album) have single handedly sent me down a melodic punk rabbit hole. The genre as a whole is a massive contradiction, this intensely technical playing contrasting with the fuck-you attitude of it’s biggest stars. Even though the speed is impressive and (for me) unattainable, the music itself is incredibly easy to listen to, infectious, and addictive. This album is constantly on repeat, and it really, really helps me focus. The incredibly controlled sensory overload kind of forces me to ignore any other distractions because 3% out of the functioning 4% of my brain is occupied by the endless screaming vocals and relentless drum beat. The three hamsters that live in my head like this one a lot.</p>
