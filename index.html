        <a href= "https://youtu.be/A03N5r4Db5w" target="_blank">12 Rods - Mexico
        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">Mexico by 12 Rods is what I wish today’s new wave revival sounded like. You’ve probably heard the grating sonic torture that is whatever that “piss in my face” song is, or the constant stream (like piss) of tiktokers claiming they’ve made a new genre, when what they really made was a Cure song but really bad with 8 FL studio tape distortion effects applied.  Mexico is truly in its own genre, a beautiful bastardization of space rock, post rock, and new wave that blows me away every time I hear it. The gay? EP is one of rock music’s greatest achievements, and the beautifully fluctuating groove and sprawling synths on Mexico make this track the crown jewel. The thing that stands out to me the most is just how crisp and perfect the instrumentation is. The guitars are dripping in tone, the bass has a wonderful, percussive attack, and the drums thump and crash their way through the track in a way that makes you feel as if there’s a whole orchestra behind you. Ryan Olcott’s vocals dance their way through these instruments in a way that really makes you wonder how he can sound so monotone and so beautiful at the same time. It isn’t like it’s a very unique point of view, but I truly believe that this song is as close to perfect as a song can get. </p>
