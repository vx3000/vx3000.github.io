        <a href= "https://youtu.be/woRVReZlRO8" target="_blank">John Beltran - Flex
        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">Ten Days Of Blue is a masterpiece. Everybody knows that, shown through consistent spots on electronic music best-ofs and the fact that John Beltran was able to recover after his disastrous follow up album. While most reviews tend to focus on the softer, ambient techno tracks that play for the rest of the album, I want to spotlight the one track that really stands out. One key detail separates Flex from every other song on this record, and it’s the drums. Most tracks on the album slowly build until the drums enter, and even then they enter softly, almost unnoticed. Flex hits you right from the start with these incredibly heavy, peaky, industrial beats that just floor you. They’re seriously heavy and seriously loud, but Beltran uses them wisely. They’re constantly shifting and changing, keeping it all fresh. On an album where drums otherwise take backstage, it’s really interesting to me that the first track sounds the way it does. I think because of this abrasive, rebellious attitude, it’s my top pick on the record.</p>
