        <a href= "https://youtu.be/aquIUpi_J9Q" target="_blank">Ian O'Brien - Midday Sunshine
        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">I really, really love nu-jazz. The soft, sophisticated stylings and just general sleekness of it all has appealed to me for most all of my life. I really love uplifting ambient music too, the soundtrack to my reading sessions and (distracted) studies. Ian O’Brien’s Midday Sun takes the best of both worlds and seamlessly mashes them together. You seriously can’t start this track up without smiling just a little bit - I feel it right now. The twinkling rhodes piano and swelling synth pads never fail to inspire, with it all being kept fresh through a swingin’ drum groove and ample sound effects fading in and out. My favorite moment on the track has to be when the strings come in about halfway through, making the song feel a lot wider and more expansive. The listener feels like they just crested a hill, and have been rewarded by a beautiful view of flutes, violins, and synths. Midday Sun is a staple of my dog walks, late night drives, and time sitting on a park bench thinking about nothing at all. I don’t see that changing for the rest of my life.</p>
