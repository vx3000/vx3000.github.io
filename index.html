        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br>Volume 8 really shows off how nebulous the term “Emo” really is, with saxophone solos, acoustic tracks, and tracks from all over the world. Regret from Day Action Band is delightfully free of any of the instrumental or vocal cliches that come to define the genre. The slight rasp and repeated phrases remind me more of early experimental tracks from artists like Laraaji, and the pared-down synths and acoustic guitar sadness reminds me more of Dave Bixby than anyone who could be considered “Emo.” Still, that rawness and pain is still there. I mean, the song literally starts with “I know that having children won’t keep me alive.” It still fits the genre, but it’s much more mature. This is a song about reaching middle age, far removed from the teenage love stories that make up the majority of the emo pantheon. Instead of riding a bike past a girl’s house, the lyrics lament new countertops and quiet nights at home. Both instrumentally and lyrically, Regret is full of a quieter, but somehow more intense sadness than any other track on this compilation, and for that reason, it’s my pick.
