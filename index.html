        <a href="https://youtu.be/1N9Wnqz8Rh8" target="_blank">Mr Fingers - Can You Feel It
        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">For a short period in the late 80s and early 90s, the midwest was a mecca for the biggest innovators in electronic. Far removed from their Motown heyday, Detroit became home to the vibrant techno scene, and building off of their disco movement, Chicago became well-known as the birthplace of house. It was in this fertile landscape that Larry Heard (aka Mr. Fingers) decided to put down the drumsticks and pick up the TR-909 drum machine. After just a few days at the studio, he emerged with 3 tracks that would completely revolutionize house music. My favorite is Can You Feel It. This track created deep house, and is still one of the best songs in the genre. Part of why it’s such a wonderful listen is Heard’s amazing use of space. If you really listen, the track is incredibly sparse, just drums, bass, and pads. What matters, though, is that each one of these instruments is used to accentuate and build off of each other. The bass is so inimitably thumpy, the drums constantly shifting and grooving, and the pads providing a constant through all this change. Even though Heard wrote it when the genre was in its infancy, Can You Feel It laid an incredible blueprint for a future years to come.</p>
