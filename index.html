        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br> We’ll start it off with Friend X by Pogoh, a standout of the mostly male-fronted, midwest-focused first volume. It was a daring move on the part of the label to let this track end the album off, as it’s a pretty sharp musical departure from everything before it. Even compared to other female-fronted emo like Endive, Rainer Maria, and Eldritch Anisette, frontwoman Susie Richardson’s vocals are a lot more powerful, a lot more accusatory, and a lot more angry. While the instrumental is loud and driving, her voice cuts clear through the fold and tells a typically emo story, condemning a friend that didn’t really end up being a friend after all. My favorite touch is the trick ending this track has. Richardson’s voice quiets to a whisper, the guitars resolve, and then all of a sudden a crushing wave of thumpy drums and undulating strings arrive at the shore, washing away every previous notion you held about the track. While the first “ending” has guitars resolving to a (slightly bittersweet) chord, the real finish to the track never resolves at all. It reflects both the story told in it, and how much I come back and think about this song every day.
