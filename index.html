      </h3>
        <p class="article">After my trip to Indiana, I wanted to take a deeper look into the unique music scene surrounding IU and IUPUI. Through trips to record stores (thanks td’s cd’s and lp’s), a lot of youtube searching, and some emo rock history lessons from my dad, I found out that there was an incredibly active local scene that’s lived on even to today, evidenced by streetlights covered in flyers and scrubbed-off band stickers on every handrail. My shining star and personal holy grail of the Indy scene is Endive’s promo tape, featuring some of the best emo/hardcore that I’ve ever listened to. My favorite track from the incredibly short-lived band is Voice Without a Face. A hushed intro of twinkly guitars gives way to a melody of impossibly high pitched vocals, quiet but intricate drums, and louder strings. Then, without warning, the song’s thrown into a violent roar of sound and the tempo picks up to an impossibly fast speed. The feedbacked wail of the guitar masks just how beautiful and intricate the entire composition is, with some incredibly technical bass playing and beautiful vocals. It slows down once more, and then speeds back up into the final section. Like the sun emerging from the clouds during a rainstorm, the track is just as noisy and intense, but feels hopeful and victorious at the same time. Truly an odyssey, Voice Without a Face is an incredibly underrated track that should have a place among the pantheon of emo rock. If anyone has this cassette please fucking contact me I will pay you a lot of money!!!
