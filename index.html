        <a href="https://youtu.be/nFZSA7U5g-s?t=622" target="_blank">Relief - Levin
        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">Germany is well known for its massive punk rock scene, but the global focus on hardcore kind of overshadows an incredibly important moment in music history: the German emo revolution of the late 90s. Levin is a shining example of that era, refined English vocals and driving guitars appearing through a fog of beautiful noise. Traditional song structure and some heavy instrumentals coming in early make this track endlessly listenable, but every time you hit repeat, you discover some new intricacy in the guitars or vocals that seemingly wasn’t there before. In this way, Relief occupies a similar space to American compatriots Texas is The Reason and Sunny Day Real Estate, but experienced none of the mainstream success those bands did, which is a massive shame. Sometimes shit just works out like that, but at least the incredible online community that’s formed around music like this has ensured that anyone in the world can appreciate this amazing record.</p>
