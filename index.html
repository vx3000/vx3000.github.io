        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br>Volume 5 moves into a lot heavier territory, kind of exploring the often-overlooked boundaries that Emo has with metal. Kerith Ravine’s Two Empty Bottles combines the tone-drenched, reverb heavy rock of bands like The Smashing Pumpkins with twinklier, more contemplative emo sounds to an almost perfect degree. The call and response male-female vocals add another layer to the relatively simple instrumentation, but where this song truly shines is its structure. Constantly tumbling from quiet to loud and back again, you’re kept on your toes and waiting for anything to clue you in to the next sonic direction the track’s gonna take. The second half of the song is broken up with some half-time sections and a twinkly little interlude to keep it feeling fresh, before that twinkling slowly turns menacing and the song is launched into a violent crescendo of drums and distortion. When it ends, you realize all of a sudden that you just listened to a 7-minute song, and it felt like 3 minutes passed by. That's a hallmark of the best music, where you get so lost in the sound that you essentially time travel. While Kerith Ravine never really broke into the mainstream, most of their members went on to start successful alt-rock group Lovedrug, and some of their music still sounds like this, so check em out.
