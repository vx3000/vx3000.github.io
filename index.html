        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br>Volume 3 is probably my highlight of the whole series, because it focuses heavily on the late 90s “emocore” scene, my favorite raindrop on the whole emo umbrella. It’s a little weird then, that my favorite track is Penfold’s “Microchip,” an almost comically emo ballad that has all of the LOUD-quiet-LOUD transitions and high pitched vocals about being sexually frustrated that come to mind when you think of corny pop punk tracks. The difference comes in how raw it all feels, the overflowing sadness and anger that emanates from this track almost canceling out any criticism I would have. After a twinkly intro, the guitars harmonize together into a wave of distortion and grit, with drums thumping and crashing their way through the low roar. Interestingly, the track is actually pretty high-tempo, but the pared-back drums and 3/4s time signature make it feel a lot slower and more contemplative. Penfold stands up there with the greatest of the scene, and while they may have had a relatively short career, the amount of people influenced by their music has been astronomical.
