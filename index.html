        <p class="article">Downtempo is an almost reviled genre in the electronic music community. The late 90s pop-culture falloff of jungle meant that artists like 4Hero and Bukem turned to incredibly commercially successful (and commercially friendly) tracks that attempted to bridge the gap between waiting room music and rave bangers. Rhodes piano, acid jazz vocals, and breaks that sounded a little bit more “natural” were all part of the standard operating procedure, but what happens when you take those downtempo essentials and crank the BPM back up to jungle levels? Risk, an incredibly unique and interesting track from the early hardcore innovators Foul Play. A heavy emphasis on jazz and the echoey instruments employed bring this somewhere near intelligent DNB territory, but it doesn’t really fit that mold perfectly. Instead, it lays in a perfect middleground, picking and choosing from only the best aspects of each genre that it takes influence from. Truly an inspirational track.
