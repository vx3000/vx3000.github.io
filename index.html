        </a>
      </h3>
        <p class="article">The Emo Diaries compilations are probably my favorite cds available anywhere in the entire world. They’re consistently quality, featuring bands both known and unknown, and serve as probably the best jumping-off point into the world of emo rock anyone could ever have. The next tracks I talk about are going to be my personal favorites from each of the 12 CDs: <br> <br>Volume 7 is an excellent return to form for the series, and out of all the wonderful tracks on this compilation, Waterpistol’s This Is What I Get stands out. Forgotten in the modern day but well-known in the early 2000s, Waterpistol reminds me of a slightly more buttoned-up, emocore Penfold. Similarly strained and corny-in-a-good-way vocals mesh seamlessly with transitions from twinkly and slow to distorted and driving to create a sort of emo rock chicken soup for the soul. They aren’t doing anything particularly groundbreaking but god damn is it really, really good. My favorite sections on this track are the sections where the band builds up to that inevitable release, drums thumping and crashing while the vocals slowly grow in both volume and emotional intensity. I’m just a sucker for those telecaster arpeggios and sad lyrics about someone not loving you back. Really a great track, check it out.
